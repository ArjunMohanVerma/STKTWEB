            <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Oily skin has a shiny complexion, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). It is generally prone to acne, blackheads, and whiteheads.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is My Skin Oily?</h3>

            <h3>Tips to Take Care of Oily Skin</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleanse Regularly:</strong> Use a gentle, foaming cleanser twice a day to remove excess oil without stripping your skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Exfoliate:</strong> Incorporate a salicylic acid-based exfoliator to help unclog pores and reduce acne.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Use oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizers that hydrate without adding extra oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect from the Sun:</strong> Use a lightweight, matte-finish sunscreen daily.</li>
            </ul>
